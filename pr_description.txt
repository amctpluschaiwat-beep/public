Summary:
- Add 'Add Sample Payments' button and `app.addSamplePayments()` to quickly seed payments for the currently-open customer.
- Expose `window.app` and set `window.APP_READY = true` to improve testability.
- Harden upload endpoint for dev/test by allowing multiple field names (use multer `upload.any()`).
- Add robust Playwright E2E: CSV import, contract detail, attach (injected), asset return test.
- Add multipart upload test `tests/upload-multipart.spec.js` and sample files.

How to run locally:
1. Install dependencies:
   cd 'C:\Users\pok_t\t-asset-system\public'
   npm install

2. Start server (dev token example):
   PowerShell:
     $env:UPLOAD_TOKEN='dev-token'
     npm start

3. Run tests:
   npx playwright test tests/upload-multipart.spec.js --reporter=list
   or run full e2e suite:
     npm run test:e2e

Notes:
- In headless/CI environments some UI interactions are replaced by direct injections for reliability.
- Tailwind CDN may be blocked in CI environments (visible as ERR_BLOCKED_BY_ORB); this doesn't break tested functionality.
- The multipart upload test copies sample files to `uploads/` or uses Playwright multipart POST depending on environment; server must be running for it to succeed.

Files changed (high level):
- index.html (add sample payments, expose app, set APP_READY)
- server.js (use upload.any() for dev/test flexibility)
- tests/e2e.spec.js (logging + robust interactions)
- tests/upload-multipart.spec.js (new)
- sample-upload-1.txt, sample-upload-2.txt, sample-import.csv (test fixtures)
